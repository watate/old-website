title: Hi, I'm Walter
---

I'm a fourth-year mechanical engineering major with experience in **deep reinforcement learning**, **automation**, and **IoT** projects. 

I'm currently looking for roles in mechatronics, robotics, and manufacturing automation, but am also open to non-engineering roles which will benefit from my technical background.
