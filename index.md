I'm a fourth-year mechanical engineering major with experience in **deep reinforcement learning**, **automation**, and **IoT** projects. 

I'm currently looking at mechatronics, robotics, and manufacturing automation roles, but am also open to non-engineering roles which will benefit from my technical background.
